Preggo Care is a comprehensive pregnancy companion app designed to support expectant mothers throughout their journey. Our development is deeply rooted in **UX research methodologies**, ensuring an intuitive and user-friendly experience for all mothers-to-be.

## UX Research Methodologies  

### 1️⃣ User Research & Personas  
  We conducted extensive research to understand the needs and pain points of pregnant women. This included:  
✔ User Interviews – Expectant mothers shared their challenges, needs, and expectations.   
✔ Surveys & Questionnaires – Collected data on the most desired features in a pregnancy app.   
✔ Competitor Analysis – Studied existing pregnancy apps to identify areas for improvement.  
    
### 2️⃣ Wireframing & Prototyping  
  Our UX design process involved creating wireframes and interactive prototypes to refine user navigation and accessibility.  
✔ Low-Fidelity Wireframes: Defined app structure and primary navigation.  
✔ High-Fidelity Prototypes: Designed realistic UI/UX for usability testing.  
✔ A/B Testing & Usability Testing: Iterative improvements based on real user feedback.
